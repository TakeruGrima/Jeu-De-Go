# Jeu-De-Go
This project is an academic project in C with SDL 1.2.

This project was made in 2014 before the windows10 release. At this time
I used Windows 7 and this project runned perfectly and obtain a grade of 18.
But today if you run the project you have an visual c++ runtime library error
that I can't fix. If you want to run this project open code blocks and run
the project with debugger.

To clearly understand the project I give the file 
"rapport de projet Timoth√©eLE CORRE" that I send to my teacher in 2014 to
explain the project. I filmed the execution you can see the video to see how
it's work.
